## About Me

My name is Shun Li, a robotics engineerü§ñ candidate and a vimerüëç!

I am a highly self-promoted student and always willing to open my eyes for new knowledge and challenges.
Several year experience, from the field of UAV modeling/control to robotics localization/mapping, gives me a
relative broad vision for the whole autonomous system.

I fall in love with robotics, because I gradually found all my travel and learning these years leads to a final goal:
The automation of the robot. The mechanical design, programming skills, control theory, as well as computer vision
skills that I have learned can finally contribute to that goal.

## My Education

## My Work Experience

## My Projects

I used to work on designing, modeling and controlling of the UAVs. If you have interest, please check my [fixed wing UAV formation control]() project, which is also the main part of my bachalor's thesis work at Beijing Institude of Technology, Beijing China.
But for now, my research interest includes SLAM, 3D reconstruction, Robotics as well as UAVs.

I am currently open to work as a robotic engineer.
