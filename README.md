## About Me

I am currently a master student in the feild of robotics at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada.   I got my
bachalar's degree at Beijing Institude of Technology (BIT).

My name is Shun Li, a robotics engineerü§ñ candidate and a vimerüëç!

I am a highly self-propmoted researcher and always willing to open my eyes for new knowledgements and challenges.
Several year experience, from the feild of UAV modeling and conrtol to robotics localization and mapping, gives me a relative
broad knowledgements and sight for the whole system.

I fall in love with robotics, because I gradually found all my travel and learning these years leads to final answer:
The autonomation of the robot. the mechincal design, programming skills, control theory, as well as computer vision
skills that I have learned can finally make contriute to that answer.

## My Education

## My Work Experience

## My Projects 

I used to work on designing, modeling and controlling of the UAVs. If you have interest, please check my [fixed wing UAV formation control]() project, which is also the main part of my bachalor's thesis work at Beijing Institude of Technology, Beijing China.
But for now, my research interest includes SLAM, 3D reconstruction, Robotics as well as UAVs. 


I am currently open to work as a robotic engineer.
