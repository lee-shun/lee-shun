# Shun Li

I am currently open to work as a robotic engineer🤖. If you are interested, please contact me via
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shun-li-72b596227/).

## About Me

My name is Shun Li, a robotics engineer candidate🤖 and a vimer👍!

I am a highly self-promoted🚀 student and always willing to open my eyes👀 for new knowledge and challenges.
Several year experience, from the field of UAV✈ modeling/control to robotics localization/mapping (SLAM📷), gives me a
relative broad vision for the whole autonomous system.

I fall in love♥ with robotics, because I gradually found all my travel and learning these years leads to a final goal🎯:
The automation of the robot. The mechanical design, programming skills, control theory, as well as computer vision
skills that I have learned can finally contribute to that goal.

## My Education 🧑🎓

- Master of Applied Science, Mechanical Engineering, Jan 2021 - Dec 2022

      Concordia University, Montreal, QC                                    GPA: 4.23/4.3

- Bachelor of Engineering, Flight Vehicle Design and Engineering, Sep 2016 - Jul 2020

      Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China   Weight Average Score: 87/100

## My Work Experience👨💻

- Autonomous Driving Engineer (full-time) Jul 2020 – Jan 2021

      Qingdao Webull Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. Qingdao, China

  - Cooperated with the [Laboratory of Motion Generation and Analysis](https://lmga.eng.monash.edu/research-areas/#post-642) of Monash University (Australia)
  - Developed an [automated apple-picking robot](https://www.agro-robot.net/product/greenhouse) using CNN-based apple segmentation and motion planning algorithms for the robot arm (UR5).
  - Implemented the apple segmentation with Pytorch in python, motion planning with MoveIt in C++ and visualization with ROS, Rviz and MATLAB.

## My Projects📦

I used to work on designing, modeling and controlling of the UAVs.
But for now, my research interest includes SLAM, 3D reconstruction, Robotics.
